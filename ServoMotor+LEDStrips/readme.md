# Project Declaration: Arduino Uno Servo Motor Control System

## Overview
This project aims to implement a system that controls an RC servo motor using the Arduino Uno platform. The system incorporates two buttons for moving the RC servo motor, with each button triggering a 1-degree movement in one of the two directions. Additionally, the system utilizes a NeoPixel strip (10+8) to visually represent the current position of the motor graphically.

## Features
- **Servo Motor Control:** The system enables precise control of an RC servo motor through the Arduino Uno.
- **User Interface:** Two buttons facilitate movement in both directions, allowing for easy and intuitive control.
- **Position Visualization:** A NeoPixel strip with 18 LEDs (10+8) graphically represents the current position of the servo motor.
- **Step Movement:** Each button press triggers a 1-degree step movement in the corresponding direction.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- RC Servo Motor
- Two Buttons (for motor control)
- NeoPixel Strip (10+8 LEDs)
- Connecting wires and breadboard

## Operation
1. Pressing one of the two buttons initiates a 1-degree movement of the RC servo motor in the corresponding direction.
2. The NeoPixel strip visually indicates the current position of the motor, providing a graphical representation.
3. The system is designed for user-friendly and precise control over the servo motor's movement.
