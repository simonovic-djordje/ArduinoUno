# Project Declaration: Arduino Uno Temperature Measurement System

## Overview
This project aims to create a system using the Arduino Uno platform to measure temperature at three different locations using three temperature sensors. The system displays the measured temperatures on an LCD screen, with readings shown up to one decimal point. Additionally, the system includes a switch that allows the user to choose between displaying temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

## Features
- **Triple Temperature Measurement:** The system employs three temperature sensors to measure the temperature at distinct locations.
- **LCD Display:** Measured temperatures are displayed on the LCD screen with one decimal point precision.
- **Temperature Unit Selection:** A switch enables the user to choose between displaying temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- Three Temperature Sensors
- LCD Screen
- Switch for Temperature Unit Selection
- Wiring and Connectors

## Operation
1. The system measures the temperature at three different locations using the three temperature sensors.
2. Measured temperatures are displayed on the LCD screen with one decimal point accuracy.
3. The user can toggle the switch to choose between displaying temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
